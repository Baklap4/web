:h2:2010-10-24 - 0.6.0 released

The long overdue 0.6.0 release is now here. This release brings many technological improvements as well as a lot of new gameplay features. Thanks for all the new (and old) contributors.

	Gameplay
		Multiple vocal track support (duet)
		Toggleable karaoke with songs that have separate song and vocal tracks
		Solo parts for guitars
		Big Rock Endings
		Drum Fills (with God Mode for drums)
		Instrument hit timing indicator
		Lefty-mode for guitar and drums
		Join menu for difficulty/track configuration
	Audio system completely rewritten
		Single backend: PortAudio v19 (no more plugins)
		Can still use jack/pulse/alsa etc. through PA
		Easier to maintain, simple architecture
		Different bugs and workarounds than before
	Configuration
		Sorted to category submenus and displays multiple items at once
		Ingame audio config with no need to restart Performous (except when audio devices hang)
	Controllers
		More controllers are autodetected and supported properly
		XML config file allows adding/modifying controller types without touching C++
		MIDI drum support (build-time option)
	Song browser
		Song filtering by instrument type (F5-F8)
		Song parsing improved for faster loading and other improvements
		Uses less memory due to notes not being loaded before entering a song
	Miscellaneous
		Webcam support (build-time option)
		Graphical improvements and more random backgrounds
		SVG caching system (menus load muuuch faster once cached)
		Notification system (more UI feedback)
		ss_extract now supports all SingStar PS2 DVDs (PS3 is not supported)
		Translation updates, including config localization
		Detailed verbosity controls via new logging system
		Hordes of other tweaks and fixes

For many languages the translations are currently lacking updates. Another thing we are lacking is good graphics as well as developers for the dance mode. If you think you'll be able to do better, offer your work on #performous.


:h2:2010-08-21 - Status update
Good news everyone, cross-compiling binaries from Linux for Windows is pretty much ready for prime-time. You can check for yourself by downloading a testing installer from the <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds#Windows">wiki</a>. It would be nice if you could tell us how it works for you. The Mac bundle presented previously is broken, but luckily there has been OSX development work done and we have a new one <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds#Mac_OSX">at the usual place</a>. All in all, it seems every platform is now in quite good shape.

We've now switched to using the new audio code and things seem to work rather well. Also the branch that moves controller configuration to an xml file has been merged. Although it is not yet perfect, it presents users a way to create own mappings and autodetections even though there is not yet a graphical UI for that.

The new joining menu is also now part of main codebase, but didn't arrive in time to be included in the provided testing builds. Anyway, if no significant issues rise in overall testing, perhaps we might start looking into making that long overdue 0.6 release...

:h2:2010-07-31 - Status update
We have progressed to the point where the new audio engine is pretty much on par with the previous one feature-wise. For merging, it would seem we only need some testing and tweaks to the time code calculation. Due to a bug with pause in the current audio system, the joining menu branch might require the new audio code before taken into use. Some visual clean-up is also in order. In addition, there has been initial work to move the controller mappings out of the executable, to make it much easier to add new ones.

On packaging side, stump created a script that can easily cross-compile the dependencies and Performous itself for Windows from Debian/Ubuntu. It even produces a working installer. Sadly, the resulting build is very unstable, sometimes allowing singing or dancing, but mostly just crashing when entering the song. This seems somewhat consistent with the earlier expirements when compiling in a native mingw32 environment. So, if you have experience with stabilizing gcc builds for Windows, feel free to pitch in!

Luckily, Mac OSX side appears brighter - we now have a fresh testing build at the <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds#Mac_OSX">wiki</a>. There are some rough edges that need filing, e.g. some textures disappear in fullscreen mode, but it is certainly usable and ends the era where our last OSX binaries date back to 0.5.0.

:h2:2010-07-16 - Status update
The reason why the next 0.6 release isn't out yet is because of lacking Windows and OSX packaging. However, we haven't been sitting still - there has been significant development in various feature branches. One of them, SVG caching that greatly speeds up screen transitions is already merged to the main code.

Another branch represents the next generation of our audio engine. It gets rid of the complicated plug-in system and relies on a single cross-platform backend: PortAudio. The new code brings many improvements and makes future development easier. The system is already usable - configuration implementation is the only significant thing left to do before taking it into use.

Third exciting new thing is a nearly ready instrument joining menu that allows more intuitive and more expandable per player gaming experience configuration (see development picture below). The same generic menu structure will later be used to implement better configuration screen, among other things.

We also have the first free Jonathan Coulton full band song (with separate audio for all instruments!). You can try it <a href="http://fast.performous.org/joco-fullband-rev1.tar.bz2">here</a> (note that a recent git version is required due to a bug in midi lyrics parsing).

Although the release time is unknown, Ubuntu users can rejoice as we now have a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~performous-team/+archive/ppa">Launchpad PPA</a> (see details at <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds#Ubuntu_PPA"> our wiki</a>), from where cutting edge builds of Performous can be easily installed and tested. PPA builds also include somewhat expermental midi drums and webcam background features. We have also been looking into the possibility to cross-compile Performous for Windows on Linux host. That would not only make releasing much easier, but would also allow automated nightly Windows builds.


:h2:2010-04-20 - Status update
Many fixes have been made on the code lately (SingStar ripper enhancements, left-handed support, new highscore, Windows fixes and other bugfixes). We now think that the current code is ready for a release really soon. You can help us to make sure there isn't any regression in the current git version by testing it, or for Windows users by testing the latest <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds">nightly build</a>.

We are also proud to announce that Performous has been featured in the HotPicks section of <a href="http://www.linuxformat.com">Linux Format</a>, which is the best-selling Linux title in the UK. You can find the article in English <a href="data/LXF129.hot.pdf">here</a> (&copy;Future Publishing).

Two new videos are also available on YouTube. There is one screencast from cousteau available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZQSrt_1LL0">here</a> and one video from Tronic:
