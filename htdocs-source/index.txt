Rock your friends or learn to sing better. If you are looking for a fun music game, this is it. No special hardware required, you may play guitar on your PC keyboard, sing on any microphone or webcam you happen to have and so on. If you do have SingStar microphones, Guitar Hero or RockBand instruments, or dance pads, just plug them into your USB ports and they will be autodetected by Performous.

While Performous is still in development and you will find some crappy graphics and rough edges, many users think that it already beats even those commercial games. Oh, and Performous is <b>free software</b>. That means open source, no ads or spyware included now or ever. Click that download button and give it a test run now! (Windows, Linux, OSX)

We constantly strive to improve the gameplay and the algorithms the game is built on. Performous does not attempt to clone and catch other games but instead we listen to user feedback and try to find the best solutions. The game is developed by a relatively large team of skilled people but we are always looking for new recruits. If you think you can improve something, head over to the development page for instructions.
