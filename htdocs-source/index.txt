:h2:2010-07-16 - Status update
The reason why the next 0.6 release isn't out yet is because of lacking Windows and OSX packaging. However, we haven't been sitting still - there has been significant development in various feature branches. One of them, SVG caching that greatly speeds up screen transitions is already merged to the main code.

Another branch represents the next generation of our audio engine. It gets rid of the complicated plug-in system and relies on a single cross-platform backend: PortAudio. The new code brings many improvements and makes future development easier. The system is already usable - configuration implementation is the only significant thing left to do before taking it into use.

Third exciting new thing is a nearly ready instrument joining menu that allows more intuitive and more expandable per player gaming experience configuration (see development picture below). The same generic menu structure will later be used to implement better configuration screen, among other things.

We also have the first free Jonathan Coulton full band song (with separate audio for all instruments!). You can try it <a href="http://fast.performous.org/joco-fullband-rev1.tar.bz2">here</a> (note that a recent git version is required due to a bug in midi lyrics parsing).

Although the release time is unknown, Ubuntu users can rejoice as we now have a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~performous-team/+archive/ppa">Launchpad PPA</a> (see details at <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds#Ubuntu_PPA"> our wiki</a>), from where cutting edge builds of Performous can be easily installed and tested. PPA builds also include somewhat expermental midi drums and webcam background features. We have also been looking into the possibility to cross-compile Performous for Windows on Linux host. That would not only make releasing much easier, but would also allow automated nightly Windows builds.

Many fixes have been made on the code lately (SingStar ripper enhancements, left-handed support, new highscore, Windows fixes and other bugfixes). We now think that the current code is ready for a release really soon. You can help us to make sure there isn't any regression in the current git version by testing it, or for Windows users by testing the latest <a href="http://wiki.performous.org/index.php/Nightly_Builds">nightly build</a>.

We are also proud to announce that Performous has been featured in the HotPicks section of <a href="http://www.linuxformat.com">Linux Format</a>, which is the best-selling Linux title in the UK. You can find the article in English <a href="data/LXF129.hot.pdf">here</a> (&copy;Future Publishing).

Two new videos are also available on YouTube. There is one screencast from cousteau available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZQSrt_1LL0">here</a> and one video from Tronic:

:h2:2010-02-04 - Status update
Currently we have no easy solution to the Windows audio sync issues that still cause some jerkiness and it appears that most of the audio code will have to be rewritten to really fix the issue properly. Because of this the next release will be delayed further and it is likely to be numbered 0.6 instead of another 0.5 bugfix version as there has been significant work done on improving the graphics and there also are many usability fixes. Part of the problem is that people find implementing new features more interesting than fixing complex bugs, something that I gather to be a very common problem with open-source projects where all the developers are volunteers.

:h2:2010-01-16 - 0.5.1 released
This is a source-only bugfix release, most notably fixing issues with Windows version and adding more instrument mappings. List of changes is below and the packages can be found from the download page.

	Advanced timing code for reducing jerkiness (but causes more jerkiness for some because it is not properly tuned yet)
	Dance gameplay improvements
	Many controller detection and mapping fixes
	Fix flashing singing note issue
	Fix dance game not working under Windows (missing file)
	Fix Windows font for scale in singing note lines
	Dutch translation
	Add a simple joystick button identification utility (--jstest)
	Other small tweaks

The next version (0.5.2) will be released once we sort out the remaining issues (estimated a few days) and it will also include binaries.

:h2:2010-01-13 - 0.5.0 released
<img src="imgs/menu_fi-small.jpg" alt=""/><img src="imgs/dance-multi2-small.jpg" style="margin-left: 1mm" alt=""/>
This is the first release to include <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Mac</strong> binaries as well. A lot of work has been done by Xaldyz, Zar, Stump and others to make this possible. Meanwhile a large number of improvements and new features have been added, including of course the all new dance simulator developed during December by Aave, JNikkola and Kemppi, out of whom Aave has already become a core developer, already boosting about 200 commits. Another new developer who has been very active in this release is Peque who created the new main menu and gave some face lift for the default theme, among other things. The new features include:

	Dance mode
		StepMania .sm format
		4-8 panels on each dancepad
		Multiplayer (but not together with band yet)
		Mines, hold and regular notes in various different game modes
		Keyboard and USB dancepad support
		Crappy graphics, no ITG colors and no customization (for now)
	Band mode improvements
		God Mode for guitars (similar to StarPower)
		More graphical effects (glow, fire, ...)
		Joining during game &amp; dead coming back to life
		Whammy bar gameplay
		Streak counter popup
		Guitar Hero X0 guitar support (not tested)
	Star when singing a note well
	Main menu completely reworked
	Localizations: Finnish, French, German, Italian and Spanish
	New song folder [Performous data]/songs
		The data folders depend on the OS the game is running on, including:
		On UNIX ~/.local/share/games/performous
		On Windows [Application data]/performous
		On all systems the data installation path (relative to executable)
		Old ~/.ultrastar/songs and other such folders continue to function.
	Usability
		Confirmation for song quitting
		Better usb controller navigation (e.g. drum/dancepads can be used)
		Instrumental part skipping for singing with FoF songs
		Previews start from further of the song
		In-game volume control
		Keyboard key repeat disabled (preparing for generic controller repeat)
	Internal
		Use libpng/libjpeg directly, instead of Magick++
		Navigation abstraction
		Windows fixes

Head over to the download page to get the new version. Because of the very large number of new features and due to porting to two new platforms we expect the release to be buggy. Please let us know if you find any problems. We'll try to release 0.5.1 soon with possible fixes and more new features. The Windows version is known to have various issues but we need all of them reported so that 0.5.1 can be made better (surprisingly we severely lack Windows testers).
