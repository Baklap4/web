:h2:2010-01-13 - 0.5.0 released
<img src="imgs/menu_fi-small.jpg" alt=""/><img src="imgs/dance-multi2-small.jpg" style="margin-left: 1mm" alt=""/>
This is the first release to include <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Mac</strong> binaries as well. A lot of work has been done by Xaldyz, Zar, Stump and others to make this possible. Meanwhile a large number of improvements and new features have been added, including of course the all new dance simulator developed during December by Aave, JNikkola and Kemppi, out of whom Aave has already become a core developer, already boosting about 200 commits. Another new developer who has been very active in this release is Peque who created the new main menu and gave some face lift for the default theme, among other things. The new features include:

	Dance mode
		StepMania .sm format
		4-8 panels on each dancepad
		Multiplayer (but not together with band yet)
		Mines, hold and regular notes in various different game modes
		Keyboard and USB dancepad support
		Crappy graphics, no ITG colors and no customization (for now)
	Band mode improvements
		God Mode for guitars (similar to StarPower)
		More graphical effects (glow, fire, ...)
		Joining during game &amp; dead coming back to life
		Whammy bar gameplay
		Streak counter popup
		Guitar Hero X0 guitar support (not tested)
	Star when singing a note well
	Main menu completely reworked
	Localizations: Finnish, French, German, Italian and Spanish
	New song folder [Performous data]/songs
		The data folders depend on the OS the game is running on, including:
		On UNIX ~/.local/share/games/performous
		On Windows [Application data]/performous
		On all systems the data installation path (relative to executable)
		Old ~/.ultrastar/songs and other such folders continue to function.
	Usability
		Confirmation for song quitting
		Better usb controller navigation (e.g. drum/dancepads can be used)
		Instrumental part skipping for singing with FoF songs
		Previews start from further of the song
		In-game volume control
		Keyboard key repeat disabled (preparing for generic controller repeat)
	Internal
		Use libpng/libjpeg directly, instead of Magick++
		Navigation abstraction
		Windows fixes

Head over to the download page to get the new version. Because of the very large number of new features and due to porting to two new platforms we expect the release to be buggy. Please let us know if you find any problems. We'll try to release 0.5.1 soon with possible fixes and more new features. The Windows version is known to have various issues but we need all of them reported so that 0.5.1 can be made better (surprisingly we severely lack Windows testers).

:h2:2009-12-12 - 0.4.1 cancelled, Windows alpha available
We have rather large new features in the development version and because of this the next release will be 0.5.0 rather than 0.4.1. The hilights include a new menu and of course the dance game feature, which we just tested in two player mode with actual dance pads. No release date other than "soon" has been set.

Windows alpha build from a few days ago is available <a href="http://fast.performous.org/setup.exe">here</a>. A release is coming later, once we manage to remove the rough edges, hopefully with the 0.5.0 Linux release. The OS X bundling effort has ceased for now and we really need more Mac developers to get the job done. Compiling the software is easy, but bundling has proven to be difficult.

:h2:2009-12-05 - The Slashd-- LifeHacker Effect
<img src="imgs/lifehacker-effect.png" style="float: right; border: 0;" alt=""/>
I was wondering why my network connection was lagging while playing <a href="http://springrts.com/">TA Spring</a> (a great open-source RTS game which you should also check out). The site stats revealed that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5419099/performous-is-like-rock-band-for-your-linux-pc">LifeHacker</a> had linked to us and even though I had never heard of that site before, it is apparently very popular, as seen in the statistic where you can see a huge peak even though the day isn't even over yet (picture taken at 15:00). :)

Someone also made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmSTnbBZoqI">Youtube video</a> of Performous 0.3.2 today. Unfortunately he doesn't have microphone connected to the game, apparently, so you can't see the pitch display and scoring parts at all :(

In other news, we have working <strong>Windows binaries</strong> (thanks to the hard work by Xaldyz) and it seems that we will be able to release these with the upcoming 0.4.1 release, even though some cleanup and an installer are required.

The OSX bundle doesn't look so good as apparently there are problems with bundling some of the libraries used. Compiling on MacPorts yourself is easy, so please consider that if you are a Mac user (there are instructions on the Hacking page).

:h2:2009-11-28 - Performous 0.4.0 released
<img src="imgs/guitar_sing-small.jpg" alt=""/><img src="imgs/band-small.jpg" style="margin-left: 1mm" alt=""/>
A major new release that not only contains improvements to the singing game you all love but more importantly extends the game into a full-fledged band game. Since the pre-release at <a href="http://assembly.org/">Assembly Summer 2009</a> demo party, a large amount of improvements have been done, improving both the gameplay and the graphics. It is not perfect yet, but this certainly is a good time to make a release. Changes since 0.3.2 include:
	Guitar, bass and drums
		Uses songs in <a href="http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/">Frets on Fire</a> / <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fofix/">FoFiX</a> format
		All tracks (including vocals) are supported
		Autodetection of any connected Guitar Hero and Rock Band instruments
		Support for using a keyboard as guitar controller (FoF style)
		Better hammer-on/pull-off support than in other games
		Engine tries to figure out player's intention instead of picking the nearest chord
		Multiplayer for as many players as you have instruments for
		Full 3D note visualization
	Initial hiscore support (press End in song browser)
	Textual feedback for singers after each line
	Guessing background/cover images and videos by filenames (if not specified in song files)
	SVG graphics and fail samples from Frets on Fire (GPL for the win!)
	Major changes in the internals, including a completely new audio mixer
	Configuration system improvements, now properly supports system and user conf
	Always use desktop resolution for full screen mode (instead of mode switching)
	Many minor bugs fixed
	Build/install changes and cleanup
		Installs only minimal amount of cruft
		Increased version requirements for Boost, CMake, etc.
		Various small bugs fixed
Special thanks to all the new developers who participated in this release (see a list of contributors and their activity at <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/performous">Ohloh.net</a>). Without you it would not be possible to develop the game at a rate greater than ever before :)
