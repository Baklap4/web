:h2:Troubleshooting

If you have previously installed from source, be sure to erase any files left over from that or otherwise Performous may use wrong files. Clear the following files/folders:

	/usr/local/bin/performous
	/usr/local/lib/libda
	/usr/local/share/games/performous

Performous installs other files as well, but those won't interfere with the game. See install_manifest.txt in your build folder for a full list of files installed.
