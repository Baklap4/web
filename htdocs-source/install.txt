If you get an error about unsatisfied dependencies on Ubuntu, you may have to enable the community-supported software source <strong>universe</strong> via <strong>System | Administration | Software Sources</strong>. Most users already have this enabled.

:h2:Windows

None yet, but it compiles on Microsoft Visual Studio and we'll probably get some binaries soon enough.

:h2:Mac OS X 

No software bundle currently available, but we expect one of the Mac users to package one shortly.

:h2:Other systems and development version

	Source code: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/performous/files/performous/Performous-0.3.2-Source.tar.bz2">universal</a>

	The very latest source code is available in our Git repository. See the <strong>hacking</strong> page for more information.

:h2:Troubleshooting

If you have previously installed from source, be sure to erase any files left over from that or otherwise Performous may use wrong files. Clear the following files/folders:

	/usr/local/bin/performous
	/usr/local/lib/libda
	/usr/local/share/games/performous

Performous installs other files as well, but those won't interfere with the game. See install_manifest.txt in your build folder for a full list of files installed.
