:h2:Installing songs

You may put all songs to ~/.ultrastar/songs or to /usr/local/share/games/ultrastar/songs, even if they are not in UltraStar format. In future versions we will provide something Performous-specific and possibly also look for Frets on Fire song folders.

:h2:Setting up audio output

Usually Performous can automatically figure out how to output audio, but if you have multiple sound cards or otherwise problematic setup, you may need to specify it manually. Use --pdev &lt;device string&gt; to set the audio API (alsa, pulse, jack, ...). Some devices also take parameters, e.g. alsa:plughw:0,2 will use driver alsa with ALSA device string "plughw:0,2" (conversion plugin + first sound card and the third subdevice of that). Use --pdevhelp to get the list of available devices and further help.

:h2:Setting up mics

The same as audio outputs, mics are normally detected automatically. --mics may be used for manual configuration and --michelp displays the list of devices and their usage. You may also specify the mics option multiple times to use more than one sound card, if you have many.

If you don't specify anything, Performous defaults to two microphones and will prefer the SingStar or Rock Band ones, if available.

:h2:Instruments

Any connected Guitar Hero and Rock Band instruments are detected automatically. By default the keyboard is used as a guitar controller too, but this can be disabled in the config menu.

Before a song starts, you have a few seconds to choose your difficulty level. Do this by picking a fret or by beating a drum pad. The leftmost fret/pad is for easy, the one next to that is medium and so on. If the song has multiple guitar tracks (e.g. guitar and bass), picking the orange fret (with one of the others to choose difficulty) switches between tracks. If you select anything incorrectly, you will get to play, but the difficulty will default to easy.

:h2:Adjusting audio sync

Usually it takes a fraction of a second for the sound to come out of the speakers after it has been sent out by Performous. Similarly, there's a delay on audio input. Some flat panel displays also introduce rather long delay from when the image is rendered to when it is actually displayed. Performous has to compensate for all these latencies in order to allow smooth gameplay.

:h3:A/V synchronization

This is the difference between the time it takes for the audio and the video to get out of the system. If the setting is incorrect, notes on screen will pass the black line at an incorrect time.

Adjust with <strong>F5</strong> and <strong>F6</strong> in singing screen.

:h3:Audio roundtrip latency

This is the time it takes for the audio to go out thru the sound card, to the speakers, and in via the microphone and the sound card back, all around until Performous has detected the tone. If the setting is incorrect, the pitch wave will appear mispositioned on the notes, when the singer matches his timing on what he hears (rather than on the notes seen on screen).

While in singing screen, press <strong>F4</strong> to enter synth mode, which will play the notes using synthesized sine waves. Place the microphone near a speaker and adjust with <strong>F7</strong> and <strong>F8</strong> until the pitch wave matches the notes.

:h3:Tips for reducing audio latency

In order to see your singing on screen as realtime as possible, you should try to minimize the audio input latency and the video output latency. The video output latency can be affected by frame rate and by your display, but there is little you can do about it, and also the amount of latency is usually not more than 50 milliseconds at most. The audio input latency is affected by resampling/mixing audio servers such as Pulseaudio. Preferrably you should use ALSA or JACK directly with your card, as this will provide the minimum latency.

Using analog connection to your stereo instead of S/PDIF can also often reduce the latency slightly.

:h2:Configuration menu

Most settings are modifiable via the config menu but unfortunately it does not currently allow modifying any options with text in them. These may need to be specified with commandline options or input directly to the XML config file.

Press Ctrl+S to save the currently active settings after changes or to store the --pdev and --mics settings you entered permanently.

See the keys page for more information.
