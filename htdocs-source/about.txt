What is it?

:~preface:Performous is a free cross-platform music and rhythm game.



:h2:Karaoke?

While Performous might be classified as a karaoke program, it is actually much more than that. Instead of just displaying the lyrics, notes are also displayed and the performance is scored based on how well you actually hit the notes. Unlike in most other games in this genre, you will also see the precise pitch that you are singing, so that you can see what you are doing wrong and easily (well, everything is relative) correct your pitch.

Most of the songs available also contain the original vocals and actual karaoke versions are rare.

For those who sing <em>rather than well</em>, a karaoke mode is provided. In this mode only lyrics are displayed and there are no notes or scoring.


:h2:SingStar?

Until version 0.3 we aimed to create a free cross-platform alternative for SingStar but after scrolling notes and other gameplay improvements, and actually seeing SingStar for the first time, Lasse realized that the project has gone past that and thus Performous is now actually quite different from SingStar games.

:h2:Guitar Hero or Rock Band?

Performous uses the same instruments and songs as these games and obviously the gameplay is quite similar. However, we have deviated from the original concept by changing the scoring system and other things. We aim to make the game fun to play with and to make the scoring system judge playing skills as accurately as possible so that scores rather than percentages can be used for comparing players.

:h2:StepMania or Dance Dance Revolution?

Since 0.5.0 you can use dance pad to play dance songs in StepMania format. Again, the performance is scored based on how accurately the scrolling notes are hit. Let the rhythm guide your feet!
